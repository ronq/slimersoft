Also, don't forget about ImageMagick, which has python bindings.

Had a chat with Mary via phone today. Here are the Q&A:
1) procedure for centering scintillator?
There is a button down and to the right--turn on light. This will shine through the 
objective. Should try to focus this light down to ease alignment.  
The spot light is about the same as a source, but cover camera just in case.  


2) special handling precautions for scintillator? Has coating, don't touch base 
(top yellow portion). White on edges is oxidation. Glass side is bottom. 

3) Light settings when running? Is the box switched completely off? Switched off light.

4) Confirm temperature dependence setting? Readout noise may be temperature dependent. 
So it is a battle between readout noise and thermal noise. 
Thermal noise is a constant noise throughout all pixels: not "spikey" 


5) Camera calibration? How to do? Turn on camera, attachment ring turns to close shutter,
orange light comes on, and this activates the RapidCal, and takes a few minutes.
Once light turns green, it is done. Sometimes never turns to green.
In this case, repeat. Camera has to be fully cooled. May have to be set to coldest setting.

6) Had issues with filter wheels? Don't recall......Filters should help, not hurt.
Could see 241Am and 90Sr signals with filters. These are the SEMROCK filters. 
Their efficiency is quite high.

7) Readout speed used? 1 Mhz --> use slowest.

8) With the Ti-U, can't do z position with stage? How to focus?
Nope. Must manually focus (see below). 

9) Focus procedure? Manual? Look at edge of scintillator, can see fiber optic 
Use light for this, need to adjust down to low light levels. Use Live View 
in video mode. 

10) worry about objectives hitting the motorized stage?
Biggest objective would get really close to sample. biggest is 40X
Be careful. 


11) any mounts for holder on stage? Or just put scintillator on top?
Clamp scintillator on holder---should fit. 

12) SLIMER data on external rugged disk? Safe to wipe clean?
May have uploaded everything to WIT before, but can't recall.
Check first.
 
13) Manual for Nikon NIS Elements? There is one on the computer. 
It may be on the anti-priracy thumb drive.

14) Any other hints?

15) Your best idea of problems?

16) Anything hard to reproduce? No. 241Am plots could be reproduced consistenly. 

17) Anything special about nd2 file format? 
Maybe not. Maybe only way to take movies. 

18) Any solutions/thoughts about dynamic range issues?
Have a bunch of grey scale available on camera, everything is crowded
down by 300. Camera guys thought she was crazy when brought up. 
Nothing would really blow out a pixel. 
Normally played with gain of camera and total number of possible grey scale numbers. 
2^32. Never really helped. 
Noise is around grey value of 300....

19) Will need to chat again next week!!!!!!!!!!!

20) power input for firewire cable? Problems with board?
Microscope guy was missing a bracket to hold it still.
Should get bracket. 
But always worked. Cover was loose so bracket could be installed later. 
No idea about power.

21) What is the "1/3" next to gain setting?
This is the fractional gain thing. Couldn't see a difference.
Maybe gain without E/M on. 

22) What are LUTS? It is a noise histogram: number of pixels at a certain value. 
But not sure.  
 
23) Worry about exposing camera to ambient light? While on?
Never seemed to hurt it. Try not to shine light directly onto it.

24) No filters should be in place, correct? Filters don't help signals.
Filter is tuned to CsI output. Second? Look for empty boxes to find out what the second
was tuned to.

25) Always start with lowest power.....if not far enough back you may miss activity
Start with 4x. Only use 40x when everything is fine tuned. 
This is more a function of activity area. 
Objectives are manual. 
 
26) Mode setting is all on software. Needed to use EM mode and high gain (250)
to see 241Am. Readout noise is much worse in EM mode though. 

Other notes:
Mary thought that we had proof of principle in that we had some signals from radiation.
Cs137 and 90Sr --> clearly seeing signals, just couldn't get down to carbon 14 energies.

Different readout modes: BERT, some noise problems, including readout noise.
Noise obscures the C14. 
Maybe all readout noise? 
Camera was roughly $30k. 

May have seen the 59 keV x-ray from Am241, using a source that was encapsulated.
This was in the form of the shoulder 
C14 endpoint is 156 keV:

Noise is randomly distributed and is single pixel spikes: turning up readout rate,
this increases.
