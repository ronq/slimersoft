May 28th 2013---------------
Looking through Mary's logbook. I'm going to make note of anything
interesting and/or imporant.

p18  : She thought about using ImageJ or Rimage(from R) for image processing.

p18  : She found a paper (IEEE Trans Nuc Sci 57,3, June 2010) that details 
a process for image analysis:
1) Subtract background: take BG image -- avg 1000s of frames 
   of given exp. time. Then subtract this avg from each data acq frame
2) Filter image: smooth w/ Gaussian filter, remove high freq noise
   3x3 kernel for this is 0 1 0
                          1 2 1
                          0 1 0
3) threshold image:
   lower threshold chosen so that primary gamma and secondary K x-ray 
   interactions  were well-seperated with minimal bg events 
   upper threshold set well above maximum pixel output from scint events.

p 24 : She details her analysis routine as:
1) average many BG images (averaging removes outliers)
2) subtract average BG image from each source image
3) Gaussian blur each subtracted image
4) use peakfinder on blurred images 

p 25 : She thinks she's only seeing 10% of the dynamic range, or maybe only 1%

p 27 : She does a mask calculation

p 28 : She's using the ImageJ peakfinder

p 32 : She notes that RapidCals should be done once a week

p 33 : Mary does a "true" dark count by putting the lens cap on...the camera?
       She also does a series of temperature studies with the camera detached 
       and the lens cap ON.
       She used 100ms exposures and a total length of 2 minutes here.

p 35 : She has a plot of gray value versus temperature @ MAX e- GAIN!
       It appears that the gray value goes down with temperature, and narrows.
       This implies that warmer is better (as of 3/12/12)
       She also notes in the previous page that it is hard to maintain -50C.

p 36 : looks like she's settled on running at -63.6C

p 37 : Mary has plots of Integrated Peak versus other things. A plot of 
       peak area vs integrated peak shows good linearity with no source 
       and 207Bi. 241Am shows a much wider spread, and a different scale?
       I don't get this.

p 41 : Mary makes mention of a "little black box" for blocking light, 
       perhaps over the source and scintillator

       She also makes clear that she is still using ImageJ, and has scripts.

p 44 : Mary notes that CsI(Tl) quenching is 15% @ 20 keV nuclear recoil.
       BUT this will be different for alphas.

       She is taking data at -60C and -83C again.

p 47 : Mary talked with Chris Murphy at Photometrics. 
	Temp is -83C, 
	BERT is 1.2
	exposure time is 200 ms
	gain is 500 (actually 200 is recommended)
	no binning
	
	With these settings, and a 5 min exposure using a 150 micron slide,
	90Sr can be seen.
p 48 : Mary notes that the Nikon DAQ software can forget about the filter
	turrent setting. Doing "Manage Devices" and 
	making sure the turrent is listed fixes this. 
	She also notes that the filter setting does impact the noise,
	implies there is a light leak somewhere.

p 51 : For 90Sr, Mary's "final" settings seem to be 
       50 ms exposures, 
       2x2 binning, BERT=1.2, Gain 250 and "1/3"?
       150micron CsI, 10x objective
       
       For 14C, she used 
       200ms exposures, 
       2x2 binning, BERT=1.2,
       Gain of 250, "1/3"
       45 micron CsI, 10x objective
       10 min run
