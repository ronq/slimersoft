July 19th 2013 ----------------------------------------
have coded a simulation into rat, using the deap-rat branch

Generate events INSIDE a block of scintillator.

Using NaI, and 60 keV gammas, get a spike at 26.85 keV?
Ah, the source was outside the block. 
Generate INSIDE the block: most events are full energy events.
Using CsI, I see the 26.85 keV spike and a new one at
24.05 keV

For an incident gamma at 0.060 MeV 
The single scatter Compton Edge is located at 0.01141 MeV 
The single scatter backscattered compton photon is located at 0.048590 MeV 
The double scatter Compton Edge is located at 0.007764 MeV 

Not right. 
I must be seeing something related to x-rays.

At 28.612keV:

At 32.294 keV:

Don't know what is going on. Perhaps G4 is wrong?
Nothing seems to be adding up. I'll need to turn on particle tracking to find out.

Did this for 60 keV photons. The processes at play are:
start (10^5)
phot (10^4)
Comp (328)
EIoni (128)
eBrem (even less)

using the livermore physics list for em results in VERY different results. they are more complicated now.
However, I still see two large spikes!
bottom line: there is some crazy stuff going on. 
July 20th 2013----------------------------------
Go ahead and run simulations using what I have.
ready to run Sr90, except for the 90Y bit
ready to run 14C
ready to run Co57
ready to run Am241, except there's a 13 keV x-ray present as well
ready to run Ba133, except there are some x-rays as well. 

running these jobs now.

should also run some 10,20,30,40,50 kev gamma-rays

July 22nd 2013 ------------------
Seeing the same low energy as before: gamma rays seem to be exciting some photoelectric lines.
Looking at the XCOM database, photoelectric effects DO dominate here
For iodine, there are lines at:
1.072 keV
4.557 keV
4.852 keV
5.188 keV
33.17 keV

For caesium, there are lines at:
1.065 keV
1.217 keV
5.012 keV
5.359 keV
5.714 keV
35.98 keV

The lines still don't match, but the bottom line is that the low energy photons will produce photoelectric interactions: not compton scattering

I'm seeing a feature in the Sr90 spectrum at 36.5 keV. Not sure if this is Y90, or a cross section effect.
I should generate some "pure" Y90 to see. 
Y90 has the same peak around 36.5 keV.

It appears that no matter what, I am NOT seeing the same thing as mary. This could be an angle effect: I should generate right on the CsI to test.

July 23rd 2013 ---------------
Y90 generated closer to the CsI produces the same thing: a spike at 36.5 keV. 
Make a new geometry, where events are generated INSIDE a thick scintillator.

WAIT.
I see the problem: I had TWO sensistive detectors defined! One was the source, the other the CsI.
Turn off hit finding in the source!!!!!!!!!

This seems to have helped quite a bit. 
I still see x-rays though. Let's take a close look at them!
They still do not make sense!
Y90 looks better now. 

Go ahead and re-generate events for C14, Sr90/Y90 and the gamma sources.
Jobs are running now.

It looks like Co57 is the way to go: the new simulations show the Compton Edge, and the 14 keV x-ray.

I had the wrong endpoint for Y90 decays: it was way too high. 
Regenerate these simulations.

Things look different now. I still can't reproduce Mary's simulations for Sr90 or C14: her C14 is higher in energy on average, while 
her Sr90 simulations are MUCH higher in energy on average.  

I can try to turn off the source material for both. This didn't help with the Sr90. 
Try moving the "source" closer to the CsI now:
This didn't help.
Try collimated beam

Even with a beam, I can't reproduce Mary's plots. 
Even overlapping the Sr90 and Y90, I can't reproduce Mary's plots.

Try with a very thick scintillator.
This does not work either.

Generate INSIDE. 
C14 inside looks okay
Sr90 inside does NOT: it appears that only ~100 keV of energy is being deposited.
Things become worse if the emlivermore physics list is NOT used......

I should use a MiniCLEAN Rat now ...
however, to do this, I'll need to checkout a new RAT and modify it. 

Instead, generate events using NaI. Use a macro which can use new or old rats .
It looks like secondaryHit-->Edep() works the same for both rat-deap and rat-miniclean.

???
July 24th, 2013-----------------
run gammas and see if behavior is the same
It is. I just see about 100 keV of energy.
Now I am printing out track info. 

It looks like for low energy events (50 keV) the first Edep is reading as non-zero, while for
higher energy events, the first Edep is reading as zero!!!!!

Actually, for the first Edep, the value is either zero, or always the same for 100 keV gamma events 
This is the case for 50 keV gammas too. And 500 keV gammas! And 5 keV gammas!

the first hit is always zero or 0.033169

This is not the case when the livermore library is used.
Seeing full energy deposit with 50 keV gammas and electrons. and 100 keV electrons, except in a few cases.
THings go to shit for 500 keV electrons. Debug using 100 keV electrons: explore the odd cases.


The veto hit stuff uses this to get the hit info:

G4Step aStep->GetTotalEnergyDeposit()
it neglects optical photons!

lOOK what RAT prints out:
Index : 1     used in the geometry : Yes     recalculation needed : No 
 Material : CsI
 Range cuts        :  gamma  10 um     e-  10 um     e+  10 um  proton 10 um 
 Energy thresholds :  gamma  2.2324 keV    e-  36.5478 keV    e+  35.8184 keV proton 1 keV
 Region(s) which use this couple : 
    DefaultRegionForTheWorld


Also, when I generate inside a LAr volume, the ScintillatorEdep is correct, while the secondary det edep is wrong.
So there is a problem with the secdet code I think.
Could be optical photons?

Looking at BWVetGenericChamber.cc
edep is recorded if fLastEventID != eventID || fLastTrackID != trackID
track ID may not be properly set?
or maybe eventID?

Actually what is happening is that edep is not recorded along the track steps.....just for the first step. 
commenting out the check of EventID and trackID fixes the problem!!!!!!!!!!

I've reverted the code to get rid of my debugging code. 

Okay. Time to regenerate EVERYTHING.
Jobs are running.

My Sr90 spectrum for the 150 micron CsI array looks much like Mary's, except hers has a peak at around 90 keV, and mine peaks a bit lower,
at 80 keV. 
I could try generating close to the scintillator though. Do this. 
This didn't help. 
Close enough.



Next job will be to code up a Gaussian smear algorithm for the energy deposited in the CsI, and maybe add the glass part of the slide.
