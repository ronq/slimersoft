July 19th 2013 ----------------------------------------
have coded a simulation into rat, using the deap-rat branch

Generate events INSIDE a block of scintillator.

Using NaI, and 60 keV gammas, get a spike at 26.85 keV?
Ah, the source was outside the block. 
Generate INSIDE the block: most events are full energy events.
Using CsI, I see the 26.85 keV spike and a new one at
24.05 keV

For an incident gamma at 0.060 MeV 
The single scatter Compton Edge is located at 0.01141 MeV 
The single scatter backscattered compton photon is located at 0.048590 MeV 
The double scatter Compton Edge is located at 0.007764 MeV 

Not right. 
I must be seeing something related to x-rays.
From this website:

In eV, the:
        Kalpha1    Kalpha2  Kbeta1    Lalpha1 Lalpha3   Lbeta1
53 I    28,612.0   28,317.2 32,294.7 3,937.65 3,926.04 4,220.72 4,507.5 4,800.9

At 28.612keV:
The single scatter backscattered compton photon is located at 0.025731 MeV
At 32.294 keV:
The single scatter backscattered compton photon is located at 0.028675 MeV 

Don't know what is going on. Perhaps G4 is wrong?
Nothing seems to be adding up. I'll need to turn on particle tracking to find out.

Did this for 60 keV photons. The processes at play are:
start (10^5)
phot (10^4)
Comp (328)
EIoni (128)
eBrem (even less)

using the livermore physics list for em results in VERY different results. they are more complicated now.
However, I still see two large spikes!
bottom line: there is some crazy stuff going on. 
July 20th 2013----------------------------------
Go ahead and run simulations using what I have.
ready to run Sr90, except for the 90Y bit
ready to run 14C
ready to run Co57
ready to run Am241, except there's a 13 keV x-ray present as well
ready to run Ba133, except there are some x-rays as well. 

running these jobs now.

should also run some 10,20,30,40,50 kev gamma-rays

July 22nd 2013 ------------------
Seeing the same low energy as before: gamma rays seem to be exciting some photoelectric lines.
Looking at the XCOM database, photoelectric effects DO dominate here
For iodine, there are lines at:
1.072 keV
4.557 keV
4.852 keV
5.188 keV
33.17 keV

For caesium, there are lines at:
1.065 keV
1.217 keV
5.012 keV
5.359 keV
5.714 keV
35.98 keV

The lines still don't match, but the bottom line is that the low energy photons will produce photoelectric interactions: not compton scattering

I'm seeing a feature in the Sr90 spectrum at 36.5 keV. Not sure if this is Y90, or a cross section effect.
I should generate some "pure" Y90 to see. 
Y90 has the same peak around 36.5 keV.

It appears that no matter what, I am NOT seeing the same thing as mary. This could be an angle effect: I should generate right on the CsI to test.

July 23rd 2013 ---------------
Y90 generated closer to the CsI produces the same thing: a spike at 36.5 keV. 
Make a new geometry, where events are generated INSIDE a thick scintillator.

WAIT.
I see the problem: I had TWO sensistive detectors defined! One was the source, the other the CsI.
Turn off hit finding in the source!!!!!!!!!

This seems to have helped quite a bit. 
I still see x-rays though. Let's take a close look at them!
They still do not make sense!
Y90 looks better now. 

Go ahead and re-generate events for C14, Sr90/Y90 and the gamma sources.
Jobs are running now.

It looks like Co57 is the way to go: the new simulations show the Compton Edge, and the 14 keV x-ray.

I had the wrong endpoint for Y90 decays: it was way too high. 
Regenerate these simulations.

Things look different now. I still can't reproduce Mary's simulations for Sr90 or C14: her C14 is higher in energy on average, while 
her Sr90 simulations are MUCH higher in energy on average.
